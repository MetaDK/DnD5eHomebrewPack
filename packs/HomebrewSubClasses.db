{"_id":"P9IEBheA6lHZGSkO","name":"Lorekeeper","type":"subclass","img":"icons/sundries/books/book-backed-wood-tan.webp","data":{"description":{"value":"<h2>Lorekeeper</h2>\n<p>Your archivist tradition has led you to the limits of knowledge, to the things that should not be. You know better than anyone how to face of the horrors of the universe. Your knowledge is your strength and the strength of your party.</p>\n<h3><strong>Forbidden Lore</strong></h3>\n<p>At 2nd level, you can use your studies of various monsters to provide useful insight to your allies in combat. An archivist using a lore ability can target any creature that has one of the following types: aberration, celestial, dragon, elemental, fey, fiend, monstrosity, plant, or undead. Lore abilities are mutually exclusive – when you use a lore ability with another lore ability already active, the new effect replaces the old effect.</p>\n<p>When you use a lore ability, you must make a DC 15 Intelligence check as you attempt to recall information about the selected creature. On a natural roll of 20 (before modifiers), your chosen lore ability's effects last twice as long before fading. This extended duration lasts only for one use of the ability and ends early as normal if you use another lore ability before the duration has ended. </p>\n<p>Depending on the type of creature you target when you use this ability, you may add your proficiency bonus to your roll for the check if you are proficient in the relevant skill: Arcana for aberrations, dragons, and monstrosities; Nature for elementals, fey, and plants; Religion for celestials, fiends, and undead.</p>\n<p>In order to use lore abilities, you must spend lore points. The number of lore points you possess is equal to your Intelligence modifier. You regain all expended lore points when you finish a long rest.</p>\n<p><strong>Lore: Lost Tactics</strong></p>\n<p>At 2nd level, your knowledge has taught you to recognize a monster's weak points, letting your allies strike more effectively. As a bonus action, you can spend one lore point to make an Intelligence check to identify the monster. If successful, you may designate an ally to receive advantage on their first attack roll against the creature on their turn. On subsequent turns, you can choose to allow the bonus to remain on your designated ally or you may use your bonus action to transfer this effect to a new ally. This effect lasts for a maximum of one minute.</p>\n<p><strong>Lore: Dark Foresight</strong></p>\n<p>At 6th level, your insight into monstrous anatomy and tactics better prepares you for their attacks, allowing you to call out valuable warnings to your allies. As a bonus action, you can spend one lore point to make an Intelligence check to study the monster. If successful, you may choose one ally within 30 ft. of you. Attacks made by the creature against your chosen ally have disadvantage. On subsequent turns, you may use your bonus action to transfer this effect to a new ally. The effect lasts for one minute.</p>\n<p><strong>Lore: Arcane Intuition</strong></p>\n<p>At 10th level, your experience has taught you the secrets of how monsters evoke magic, leaving you better prepared to counter such effects. As a bonus action, you can spend two lore points to make an Intelligence check to predict the monster’s movements. If successful, you may grant yourself and all allies within 30 ft. of you advantage on saving throws against the creature’s spells or other magical effects. Allies do not need to remain within 30 ft. of you to gain this benefit, but the ability only affects those who are within 30 ft. when it is first used. This effect lasts for one minute.</p>\n<h3><strong>Adept Scholar</strong></h3>\n<p>Beginning at 10th level, you regain all expended lore points on a short or long rest.</p>\n<h3><strong>Master Scholar</strong></h3>\n<p>At 14th level, your practice in studying monsters and magic makes you more skilled at quickly recognizing these phenomena around you. Choose one of the following skills: Arcana, Nature, or Religion. Whenever you make a check using your chosen ability, you may add your Wisdom modifier to the check.</p>\n<p>In addition, you gain additional lore points when you reach 14th level. Your total number of lore points is now equal to your Intelligence modifier + your Wisdom modifier.</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"source":"https://www.reddit.com/r/UnearthedArcana/comments/4lbszl/the_archivist_a_5e_adaptation_of_the_35_class/","identifier":"Lorekeeper","classIdentifier":"Archivist","advancement":[{"_id":"jprfkvpp7v00fruk","type":"ItemGrant","configuration":{"items":["Item.CS5Vbu17yKljltxV","Item.i6FlHNCTRnPlCeTK"],"optional":false},"value":{},"level":2,"title":"Bonus Feature(s)","icon":""},{"_id":"cuapb40d3nrixqen","type":"ItemGrant","configuration":{"items":["Item.j1tGq0DWqPftEsZ2"],"optional":false},"value":{},"level":6,"title":"Bonus Feature(s)","icon":""},{"_id":"02gdk7o0roig26eu","type":"ItemGrant","configuration":{"items":["Item.p0OGZ8Q6IyF15MgQ","Item.wMpO02A4A18fwsZ0"],"optional":false},"value":{},"level":10,"title":"Bonus Feature(s)","icon":""},{"_id":"8rvkyr56481yxm4v","type":"ItemGrant","configuration":{"items":["Item.uR47iV8fATHQfU8y"],"optional":false},"value":{},"level":14,"title":"Bonus Feature(s)","icon":""}],"spellcasting":{"progression":"none","ability":"int"}},"effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"VikgKbf4mFwdVNao":3},"flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"Compendium.DnD5e_Homebrew-Pack.HomebrewGear.P9IEBheA6lHZGSkO"}}}
{"_id":"ohSvbKqBBGHhusAd","name":"Arcane Scribe","type":"subclass","img":"icons/sundries/books/book-purple-gem.webp","data":{"description":{"value":"<h2>Arcane Scribe</h2>\n<p>Your archivist tradition is that of the arcane scribe, seeking obscure magical knowledge and learning to cast spells which are usually only practiced by a select few. Your thirst for knowledge is matched only by the skill with which you wield your magic. You are a collector of information, a student of magic in all its forms.</p>\n<h3><strong>Arcane Adept</strong></h3>\n<p>At 2nd-level, your reflexive grasp of magic allows you to create a wide array of simple effects. Add three cantrips from any spell list to your list of cantrips known. These are in addition to the number of cantrips known listed in the Archivist table. The cantrips need not be from the same spell list.</p>\n<h3><strong>Divine Knowledge</strong></h3>\n<p>At 6th level, you gain the ability to utilize many forms of divine magic, even forms outside of the usual scope of an archivist's studies. Add three spells of your choice from among the cleric, druid, paladin, or ranger spell lists to your prayerbook. A spell you choose must be of a level you can cast, as shown on the archivist table, or a cantrip. The chosen spells count as archivist spells for you and can be prepared as normal.</p>\n<h3><strong>Higher Mysteries</strong></h3>\n<p>At 10th level, you tap into divine magic known only to a few. Choose one cleric domain. The domain’s spells are added to your prayer book, count as Archivist spells for you, and may be prepared as normal. For any domain spells which are already in your prayer book, you may select one spell of the same level from the Archivist spell list to add to your prayer book.</p>\n<h3><strong>Practiced Efficiency</strong></h3>\n<p>At 14th level, your studious practice with magic enables you to more effectively utilize your resources in combat. When you cast a spell of 3rd level or lower with a casting time of one action, you may cast a cantrip as a bonus action. This feature can be used a number of times equal to your Wisdom modifier. All expended uses recharge at the end of a long rest.</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"source":"https://www.reddit.com/r/UnearthedArcana/comments/4lbszl/the_archivist_a_5e_adaptation_of_the_35_class/","identifier":"ArcaneScribe","classIdentifier":"Archivist","advancement":[{"_id":"90euvx9q2w52msi7","type":"ItemGrant","configuration":{"items":["Item.X55m66mcmp52tNLJ"],"optional":false},"value":{},"level":2,"title":"Bonus Feature(s)","icon":""},{"_id":"fgob461w3al2jmtm","type":"ItemGrant","configuration":{"items":["Item.jNc1pOWb6jTt0oWO"],"optional":false},"value":{},"level":6,"title":"Bonus Feature(s)","icon":""},{"_id":"jgc83jazzbzv9gr8","type":"ItemGrant","configuration":{"items":["Item.jjeoPDVkc5Mw5i2N"],"optional":false},"value":{},"level":10,"title":"Bonus Feature(s)","icon":""},{"_id":"d9multa6a4r4vsq2","type":"ItemGrant","configuration":{"items":["Item.k8UNzoGhnwouvTcN"],"optional":false},"value":{},"level":14,"title":"Bonus Feature(s)","icon":""}],"spellcasting":{"progression":"none","ability":"int"}},"effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"VikgKbf4mFwdVNao":3},"flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"Compendium.DnD5e_Homebrew-Pack.HomebrewGear.ohSvbKqBBGHhusAd"}}}
